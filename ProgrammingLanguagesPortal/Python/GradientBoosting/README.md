# Gradient Boosting
Gradient boosting is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, which lies in building an ensemble of successively refined elementary models, namely decision trees. Therefore, there are special libraries designed for fast and convenient implementation of this method. 

Namely, we think that XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost deserve special attention. They are all competitors that solve a common problem and are used in almost the same way. These libraries provide highly optimized, scalable and fast implementations of gradient boosting, which makes them extremely popular among data scientists and Kaggle competitors, as many contests were won with the help of these algorithms.
